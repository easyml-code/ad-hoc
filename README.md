# Ad-Hoc Projects and Scripts Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I store all my ad-hoc task/project codes! This repository is a collection of scripts and projects covering various topics such as:

- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from websites using tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
- **Data Pulling**: Fetching data from APIs or other online sources.
- **APIs**: Handling API requests and responses, as well as automation tasks.
- **Image Resolution Improvement**: Scripts to enhance image quality and resolution.
- **File Extension Changing**: Automating bulk changes to file extensions.

Each folder contains a project or script focused on solving a specific problem, with detailed comments and documentation where necessary.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Web Scraping
- **Example**: Automated scraping using Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup to extract data from websites and save it in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).
  
### 2. Data Pulling
- **Example**: Scripts for retrieving large datasets via APIs, with retry mechanisms and error handling.

### 3. API Handling
- **Example**: Working with REST APIs, making GET/POST requests, and processing JSON responses.

### 4. Image Processing
- **Example**: Improving image resolution using Python libraries such as OpenCV or PIL.

### 5. File Operations
- **Example**: Automating the renaming and extension changes of large batches of files.
